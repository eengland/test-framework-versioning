The PE format is a data structure that encapsulates the information necessary for the Windows OS loader to manage the wrapped executable code. This includes dynamic library references for linking, API export and import tables, resource management data and thread-local storage data. Software should be transferred in its native/original format, but should be provided as both raw source code and a compiled runtime version, if it exists. It should also be accompanied by release notes, readme files, and user/administrative documentation, if they exist. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files.",
